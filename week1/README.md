## Project Details

Week 2 (originally 1) of project a week! I am starting with something with OOP since I need to touch up on it for interviews and tests. This card game randomly came into my head while I was yapping on call with Nityant Rathi.

# 🎯 Objective

Play standard Texas Hold’em, but after each round of betting, players still in the hand may **“Hit”** (draw extra cards) to improve their five-card Poker hand.  

- Hitting introduces **Blackjack risk** — anyone who busts forfeits after the round ends.  
- **Standard Poker hand rankings** always determine the winner.  
- Blackjack totals are used **only for busting and bonus conditions** (see bonus conditions for hitting 21 below).
